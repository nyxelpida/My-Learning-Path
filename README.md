# My-Learning-Path
 My personal learning path with lab reports and exercises on cybersecurity and programming.

### Naming Convention

All lab reports follow the naming pattern: `WX-DY-LZ`, which stands for:

- **WX** → Week number (e.g. `w1` = Week 1)  
- **DY** → Day number within the week (e.g. `d1` = Day 1)  
- **LZ** → Lab number of that day (e.g. `l1` = Lab 1 of the day)

For example:  
`W1-D1-L1.md` → Week 1, Day 1, Lab 1  
`W2-D3-L2.md` → Week 2, Day 3, Lab 2
